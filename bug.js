In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating to a route that doesn't exist.  This often results in a silent failure, leaving the user on the same page without any error message.  The problem is exacerbated when using `useNavigate` and not handling the potential for an invalid route. For instance:

```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleClick = () => {
    navigate('/invalid-route'); // Navigating to a non-existent route
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to Invalid Route</button>
  );
}
```
This code snippet silently fails to navigate to `/invalid-route`.
